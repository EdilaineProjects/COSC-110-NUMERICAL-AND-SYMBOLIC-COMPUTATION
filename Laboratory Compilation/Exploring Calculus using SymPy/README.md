# Laboratory 4: Exploring Calculus Using SymPy

In this lab, you will explore fundamental calculus concepts through symbolic computation with SymPy:

- **Symbol Manipulation**  
  Learn how SymPy represents and combines symbols.

- **Limits**  
  Compute limits of functions to understand behavior near critical points.

- **Derivatives**  
  Calculate the derivative of simple functions to see how rates of change are determined.

- **Series Expansion**  
  Generate a truncated Taylor series and interpret the terms and Big‑O notation.

- **Equation Solving**  
  Solve algebraic equations symbolically.

- **Reflection**  
  Reflect on insights gained, favorite parts of the activity, and how SymPy bridges algebra and calculus.

By completing these steps, you’ll gain hands‑on experience in symbolic calculus, preparing you for advanced mathematical modeling in Python.
