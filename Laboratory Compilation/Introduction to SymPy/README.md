# Laboratory 3: Basic Symbolic Computation with SymPy


In this lab, you will explore the power of **symbolic mathematics** using the SymPy library:

- **Environment Setup**  
  Import the core SymPy modules to enable symbolic computation.

- **Basic Calculations**  
  Combine fractions and square‐root expressions symbolically, without converting to numerical approximations.

- **Symbol Definition & Equation Building**  
  Define variables (e.g., `x`, `y`) as symbols and construct simple algebraic equations to represent relationships programmatically.

- **Expression Simplification**  
  Apply SymPy’s algebraic rules to reduce complex rational and polynomial expressions into their simplest forms.

- **Polynomial Expansion**  
  Use SymPy’s expansion capabilities to transform factored expressions (such as binomials and squared terms) into standard polynomial form.

By completing these steps, you will gain hands‑on experience in manipulating and solving algebraic expressions programmatically, laying the groundwork for more advanced computational mathematics.
